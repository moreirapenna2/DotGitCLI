## About The Project

This script is derived from [DotGit](https://github.com/davtur19/DotGit/tree/master) by davtur19.

It's not as good as DotGit, and the code was rushed and mostly copilot written, but it seems to work fine.
Use this if you need to check for basic exposed files and can't use your browser or can't install extensions.

## Prerequisites
* [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Usage
```sh
  python3 dotgitcli.py <URL> <PROXY (optional)> --no-verify (optional)
  ```

## Contributing

Feel free to fix bugs, add new validations, prettify the code, or whatever you think it's gonna make this better.
